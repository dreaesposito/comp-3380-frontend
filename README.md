## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get set up with React and Vite (a tool to help speed up render times when making changes to the code).

### Getting started with React

[Basic React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)

### React Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a general library of components that can be imported into any web project. [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/why-react-bootstrap/) is a complete re-implementation of the Bootstrap components using React.

The [component documentation](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/components/accordion) will probably be your best friend for finding all the components and seeing their properties/styling options. In addition to style components, it also provides a mechanism using containers, rows, and columns to help guide the design process.

### Running the project

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dreaesposito/comp-3380-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory

   ```sh
   cd comp-3380-frontend
   ```

3. Install node modules

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Create your own branch (can also do this from the IDE)

   ```sh
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

5. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
